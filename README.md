### GitHub Pages Setup (Optional)
If you want to host a static website for the repository:

1. Create a branch named `gh-pages` for hosting GitHub Pages.
2. Use a static site generator like Jekyll or MkDocs to generate HTML pages from the markdown files.
3. Deploy the site via GitHub Pages under the repository settings.

### Tips for Organizing the GitHub Repo
- Use **issue tracking** for bugs or corrections in the exercises.
- Enable **discussions** for community support, sharing solutions, or asking questions.
- Use **tags and releases** to version different iterations of the support material (e.g., for different editions of the book).

This structure will ensure that the repository is easy to navigate, well-organized, and user-friendly for readers and learners.
